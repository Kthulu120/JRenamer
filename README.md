## JRenamer
A small quick tool to rename directories and movie files according to directory names/the largest file in a child directory
#### Notes
This application is meant to be used on small scales but should work with larger scales easily. It was made hastily as a quick solution for a renaming problem I had for my media but shouldn't have any bugs to mess up your media it works for empty directories don't worry. I'll accept PRs for this if someone wants to maintain it or add features. The exe for windows can be found on the releases page.
